		<p class="cv_title">Hi, I'm Tim. I try to build things which I would enjoy using.</p>
			
		<p>I don't put up with a lot of crappy experiences. If something isn't fun to play, pleasurable to use, or inspirational to watch, then I'll trash it. I try to always look for that one
			nuggets of enjoyment in everything I design and build. If the foundation is solid, users will throw features and requests into every crevice they can find.</p>
			
		<p>I was educated in Computer Science, so I have classical coding skills and love to put them to use building games, tools, and apps. Most of my work has been on the web; I grew up obsessed with
			 HTML, CSS, and Javascript after I found a Dreamweaver book at a local garage sale.</p>
		
		<p>I've been programming since about 2003 and started getting into UX during my third year of college, once I decided to follow the Human-Computer Interaction track.</p>
		
		<p>I mostly work as a developer of high-impact enterprise web applications. I work closely with our UX team, even so much as to design and user-test, myself. I don't find much value in designing and developing separately. Working
			with UX closely, from inception, has yielded the best results to me and allows both teams to develop empathy and understanding of each other's issues.</p>
			
		<p>While most of my time is spent with UX, extremely significant time is spent working with Product Management, Quality, and Back-end Development. 
			All of these teams are spread through-out the world, between language barries, which makes it all the more difficult, but fulfilling.</p> 
		
		<p>I always found our abilities to communicate other than by writing to be extremely powerful. We have these hands, vocal cords, ears, and skin which all allow us to communicate and interact with each other,
			but we handicap ourselves by only allowing interaction with computers through these secondary interfaces of the keyboard, mouse, and monitor.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>I'm here to make computers better at interacting with humans, not to train humans to interact with computers.</b></p>
