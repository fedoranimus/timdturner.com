            My name is Tim Turner and I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota. My emphasis is in Human-Computer interaction and I strive to help computers succeed in interacting with human beings.

        <p>
            In my professional career, I have experience as a software engineer, information architect, and as a product designer. This provides me with the necessary skills to be empathetic of the end-userâ€™s needs and goals when using software, understanding of the technical difficulties and requirements when building software, as well as promoting the larger vision when designing software.
        </p>
        <p>
            These skills and experiences ensure that I am uniquely positioned to be the liaison between all teams and team members to ensure you deliver the best product to satisfy and delight your users.
