            I could never find a meditation app that I enjoyed. Every one I found was too overstyled or too packed full of features. I wanted a simple timer to help me build my habit, so I built one.
            </p>
            <p>
            Remove all the distraction of interface, without removing the ability to be useful. Sit, relax, and Just Meditate.

         The best way to understand <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fedoranimus.tim.justmeditate&hl=en">Just Meditate</a> is to download and use it. Check it out currently on Google Play.

         Meditation is easy, we just need a push.

         <p>
         Meditation has enormous emotional and cognitive benefits. However, humans have a biased towards easy things - we feel that is something is easy and simple that it has very little value and payoff.
         </p>
         <p>
         That's why I designed Just Meditate to get more and more difficult by increasing the session length as the user gains levels and understanding.  The user can also see a history of meditation sessions, view their progress over time, and keep track of their longest and current streak!

         A significant portion of this app will be used to gather anonymous data on its users mood and how significant it is.
         </p>
				 <p>
			   The system records a voluntary value at the beginning and at the end of a meditation session. This value is used to understand the mood of the user and how it changes. Additional data such as time of day, day of the week &amp; month, and session length will all be considered to give a user proactive notification of when they should take a break and Just Meditate.

         <p>
         I plan to produce an iOS and Universal App for Just Meditate in the near future. Until then, I'll be working very hard on adding EEG integration to give the user that extra data point to track and understand.
