            Many companies seem to have issues with employees not submitting their timesheets on time. There is very little incentive to do this for the average employee. We attacked the issue with a game with points, achievements, and meta-world aspects during my ModC2 internship.

         We wanted our logo to be intimidating, but also intriguing. This is what we came up with.

         This is what you would see upon logging in. Your character has a small indicator over it, the players who have submitted their timesheets are in full color, and the slackers who haven't are faded out and sleeping.

         Want to know who is on your team at a glance? That's what this is for. Each name is selectable and leads to the player's profile. You can also mouse-over each character on the field to see their name and click on them for the profile screen as well.

         Want to know how well you're doing compared to the rest of the company? That's what the leaderboard is for! Maybe even end-of-the-year bonuses are based on your score value.

         Gamers love achievements, so we gave them achievements for winning, losing, being first or last, and different streaks.

         Since it's a four-way tug of war, we decided there can only be one loser and only one victor. The other two teams are just null. We can see the Pandas won this round and the Cats were defeated.
