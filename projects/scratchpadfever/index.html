            The ModC1 Intern team was tasked to create a fun and quirky Flash game. ScratchPad Fever uses real-world items to progress through a virtual artistic challenge arena. Scratchpad Fever was nominated for a <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2012/web/general-website/games/scratch-pad-fever/">2012 Webby Award</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Everything was created internally by our small team, from the visual design and music to the user experience and ActionScript code.

         I encourage you to take <a href="http://scratchpadfever.modernclimate.net/">ScratchPad Fever</a> for a spin. The best way to understand the game is to try it - be sure you have a computer with a webcam though!

         I'm not very good at ScratchPad Fever as the shape rapidly become very complex and the time is very short. I quickly lost all three of my lives and failed at my own game!
         </p>

         The game was originally created as a way to use all of a piece of scratch paper before recycling it. It echoes my desire to find the fun and benefit in anything and everything.

         It would be fantastic to rebuild ScratchPad Fever using the HTML5 umbrella now that Flash is quickly being cut from browsers. I'd love to expand the game to be a mobile "Eye-Spy" game for children as well; a way for kids to use their cellphones and still interact with the physical world.
