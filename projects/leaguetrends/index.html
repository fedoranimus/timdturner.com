            I wanted to explore interesting trends and conjecture from a collection of League of Legends matches. This project was created as a final for a Data Visualizations course during college.
            </p>
            <p>
            All of the data was gathered by hand and the visualizations were designed and created by me. You can explore it <a href="http://timdturner.com/visualization/">here</a>.

         I was able to make predictions and gain insight into a standards League of Legends match at my skill level.

         <p>
         The team that gathers the most gold wins in very single game I've played. This is because more gold means better items. Since gold is gathered by killing enemies, the winning team often has more overall kills as well.

         <p>
         Over a year after I built my little system, Riot Games (the creators of League of Legends) came out with "Match History". Since they have access to much more data, they're able to create many more visualizations.
         </p>
         <p>
         However, one of theirs looks extremely similar to mine - I found this interesting.
